## Key Scientific Contributions

### 1. Mechanistic Drug Effect Implementation

**Novel Approach**: Model explains **why** tacrolimus increases risk and sirolimus decreases risk:

- **Tacrolimus**: Binds FKBP-12 → Creates permissive environment → 2.0-2.3x risk increase
- **Sirolimus**: Binds FKBP-12 → Blocks mTOR pathway → 90% inhibition at 4 ng/mL
- **Timing Dependence**: Sirolimus effective only in early phase (0-24h), 30% effectiveness in late phase

**Clinical Impact**: Helps clinicians choose optimal immunosuppression regimens

### 2. Clinical Viral Load Mapping

**Novel Approach**: Bridges cellular-level simulation to blood-level measurements:

- Population scaling from single cell to plasma copies/mL
- Renal clearance kinetics and plasma distribution
- Clinical threshold integration (1,000 and 10,000 copies/mL)
- Log-scale transformation for clinical relevance

**Clinical Impact**: Enables direct comparison of simulation results to patient blood tests

### 3. Hybrid Risk Prediction

**Novel Approach**: Combines mechanistic simulation with ML for enhanced prediction:

- **Clinical-only model**: Traditional risk factors (age, sex, prior transplant, etc.)
- **Enhanced model**: Clinical + virtual cell features (peak load, clearance, phase duration)
- **Potential improvement**: Captures biological mechanisms not in clinical-only models

**Clinical Impact**: More accurate risk stratification for personalized treatment

### 4. Research-Grounded Parameter Registry

**Comprehensive Documentation**: 24 parameters with:

- Evidence sources (specific papers and clinical cohorts)
- Confidence levels (HIGH: 8, MEDIUM: 13, LOW: 3)
- Value ranges and calibration notes
- Clinical interpretation

**Scientific Impact**: Transparent, reproducible research methodology
