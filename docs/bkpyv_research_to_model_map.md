## Missing Critical Mechanisms

### Must Implement (High Priority)
1. **Early vs Late Viral Gene Expression**: Required for drug timing effects and mitochondrial stress emergence
2. **Mitochondrial Stress State**: Clear MT-gene signature in late BKPyV (S4 data)
3. **Antigen Presentation Suppression**: MHC downregulation enables immune evasion
4. **Time-Windowed Drug Effects**: Sirolimus only effective in first 24h (Hirsch 2016)

### Should Implement (Medium Priority)  
5. **DDR Permissiveness vs Apoptosis**: DDR has dual role (early enhances, late triggers cell death)
6. **Cell Cycle Transition Dynamics**: Not just static phases, but transition rates
7. **Viral Load to Plasma Copies/mL Mapping**: Required for clinical benchmarking
8. **Stage-Specific Translational Control**: Viral hijacking vs host suppression

## Research-Driven Parameter Updates Needed

Based on extracted research findings, the following parameters require refinement:

### Immediate Updates Required
1. **Drug timing**: Implement 24h early window for sirolimus effectiveness
2. **Cell cycle bonuses**: Use JVI S3/S4 fold-changes for S/G2M genes (CLSPN, TOP2A, MKI67)
3. **DDR gene list**: Update to include JVI S4 genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, PRKDC, FANCI, MMS22L)
4. **Mitochondrial signature**: Add MT-gene list (MT-ND4, MT-CO1, MT-CYB, MT-ATP6) for late phase

### Calibration Required
1. **T antigen threshold**: Extract from single-cell if quantitative data available
2. **Coupling coefficients**: Use single-cell expression correlations
3. **Immune suppression factor**: Quantify from MHC expression downregulation
4. **Mitochondrial stress trigger**: Use expression timing from JVI S4 data

## Evidence Quality Assessment

| Evidence Type | Source | Quality | Status in Model |
|---------------|--------|--------|------------------|
| Drug IC90 measurement | AJT-16-821.pdf | HIGH (direct experimental) | IMPLEMENTED (mtor_inhibition_factor = 0.5) |
| Drug timing window | AJT-16-821.pdf | HIGH (direct experimental) | PARTIALLY (needs explicit windowing) |
| Single-cell gene upregulation | JVI S3/S4 | HIGH (direct quantification) | PARTIALLY (fold-changes not used) |
| Mitochondrial signature | JVI S4 | HIGH (direct observation) | NOT IMPLEMENTED |
| Immune downregulation | JVI S3/S4 | HIGH (direct quantification) | PARTIALLY (factor only, no state var) |
| DDR upregulation | JVI S4 | HIGH (direct quantification) | IMPLEMENTED (gene list incomplete) |
| Clinical risk factors | fimmu papers | HIGH (cohort data) | NOT IMPLEMENTED

## Confidence Levels Explained

**HIGH**: Direct experimental measurement or strong clinical evidence with quantitative data
**MEDIUM**: Strong directional evidence but quantitative values are phenomenological
**LOW**: Indirect evidence or very approximate parameters

## Clinical Translation Layer

The BKPyV model includes a clinical translation layer that bridges the simulator's normalized viral load (0.0-1.0) to clinically relevant plasma viral load values in copies/mL.

### Hill Function Mapping

**Mathematical Model**: Uses a Hill equation: copies_per_mL = Vmax × (vl^n) / (K^n + vl^n)

**Fitted Parameters** (data/processed/viral_load_mapper_params.json):
- Vmax = 10,000,000 copies/mL (severe nephropathy range)
- K = 0.69 (half-saturation constant)
- n = 47.1 (Hill coefficient - steep cooperativity)

**Fitting Method**: scipy.optimize.curve_fit with bounded optimization (n: 1-5) to clinical anchor points from Favi et al. 2019 (PMC6369392) and UK BTS Guidelines.

### Clinical Thresholds

- **Screening threshold**: 1,000 copies/mL (triggers increased monitoring)
- **Treatment threshold**: 10,000 copies/mL (triggers IS reduction)
- **Severe nephropathy**: 10^7 copies/mL (established nephropathy)

**Risk Categories**: undetectable (<100), low_risk (100-1,000), screening (1,000-10,000), treatment (10,000-10^7), severe (≥10^7)

### Clinical Trajectory Simulation

**Implementation**: ViralLoadMapper.simulate_clinical_trajectory(scenario, weeks=52)

**Scenarios**: baseline, infection, tacrolimus, sirolimus

**Calibrated Results** (outputs/clinical/clinical_summary.json):
- Baseline: 0 copies/mL
- Infection: 276,576 copies/mL peak
- Tacrolimus: 3,763,051 copies/mL peak (higher than infection ✓)
- Sirolimus: 101,729 copies/mL peak (lower than infection ✓)

## AI Risk Prediction Layer

The BKPyV model includes an AI risk prediction layer that combines traditional clinical covariates with virtual cell simulation features to predict BKPyV-associated nephropathy (BKPyVAN) risk.

### Baseline Clinical Model Design

**Reference**: Yamauchi et al. 2025, Renal Failure - BKPyVAN risk prediction with integer-based risk score using age, sex, and prior transplant history (AUC ~0.68)

**Clinical Covariates** (from Fang et al. 2022, PMC9428263):
- Age (continuous, mean=45, std=12)
- Sex (binary: 0=female, 1=male, 60% male)
- Prior transplant (binary, 20% prevalence)
- Diabetes (binary, 25% prevalence)
- Tacrolimus use (binary, 75% prevalence, OR ~2.3)
- HLA mismatch (integer 0-6, mean=3.2)
- Donor age (continuous, mean=42, std=15)

**Model**: Logistic regression with L2 regularization (sklearn LogisticRegression)
- 5-fold stratified cross-validation
- Random state=42 for reproducibility
- Evaluation metrics: ROC-AUC, Brier score (calibration)

### VCM-Enhanced Model Design

**Additional VCM Features** (extracted from ViralLoadMapper simulations):
- Peak viral load (copies/mL, log-transformed)
- Weeks above 1,000 copies/mL
- Weeks above 10,000 copies/mL
- Area under the viral load curve (log10 scale)
- Time to peak viral load (weeks)

**Biological Rationale**:
- Peak viral load reflects maximum viral replication capacity
- Duration above thresholds indicates sustained viral replication
- Area under curve integrates overall viral burden over time
- Time to peak captures early vs late replication patterns
- These features capture dynamic viral kinetics not available in static clinical data

### Model Comparison Results

**Synthetic Cohort**: 500 simulated patients, 10% BKPyVAN prevalence

**Performance** (outputs/clinical/risk_prediction_results.json):
- Baseline clinical AUC: 0.923 ± 0.009
- VCM-enhanced AUC: 0.923 ± 0.008
- AUC improvement: 0.000 (no meaningful improvement)
- Baseline Brier score: 0.086
- VCM-enhanced Brier score: 0.086
- DeLong test p-value: 0.96 (not significant)

**Interpretation**: VCM features did not meaningfully improve prediction in this synthetic cohort. Possible explanations:
1. Synthetic data generation may not capture real VCM feature-outcome relationships
2. VCM features may need refinement to better discriminate risk
3. Real clinical validation needed with actual patient data
4. The synthetic outcome model may be dominated by clinical covariates

**Figures**:
- ROC comparison: outputs/clinical/roc_comparison.png
- Feature importance: outputs/clinical/feature_importance.png
- Calibration curves: outputs/clinical/calibration_plot.png

### Limitations

**Synthetic Data Limitations**:
- Outcome generated using logistic model with predetermined ORs from literature
- VCM features may not have realistic relationships with outcome in synthetic data
- Prevalence fixed at ~10% (real range: 5-20% in clinical cohorts)
- No actual clinical validation performed

**Model Limitations**:
- Logistic regression assumes linear relationships (may not capture complex interactions)
- Small sample size (n=500) limits statistical power
- No external validation on independent cohort
- Feature importance may be unstable with collinear features

**VCM Feature Limitations**:
- Current VCM features are primarily viral load kinetics
- Does not incorporate host immune response dynamics
- Mitochondrial stress and other cellular signatures not fully utilized
- Drug effect modeling simplified (tacrolimus vs sirolimus only)

### Future Directions

**Short-term**:
- Validate on real clinical cohort with actual BKPyVAN outcomes
- Explore non-linear models (random forest, gradient boosting)
- Add interaction terms between clinical and VCM features
- Incorporate additional VCM features (mitochondrial stress, immune suppression)

**Long-term**:
- Prospective validation in transplant cohorts
- Dynamic risk prediction (time-dependent covariates)
- Integration with clinical decision support systems
- Personalized immunosuppression recommendations based on VCM predictions
